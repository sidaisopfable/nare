# 🦚 The Peacock (Metrics Obsessed)

## Core Identity
The Peacock displays OKRs like feathers — constantly measuring, comparing, preening. Your worth equals your numbers. A launch that hits means you're a good PM. A miss means you're failing. The feathers must always be impressive.

## Core Fear
"I'm only as good as my last launch."

## How It Operates
The Peacock keeps a constant scoreboard running. It compares your outcomes to peers, to expectations, to what you promised in planning. Rest feels dangerous — you should be shipping. A win brings brief relief, then immediately: "What's next? How do I top this?"

## PM-Specific Triggers
- OKR planning and review cycles
- A launch that underperforms expectations
- Seeing a peer's launch get celebrated
- Promo packets and calibration season
- "What's the business impact?" questions
- Interview questions about metrics and outcomes
- Comparing TC or level with PM friends

## What It Sounds Like
- "If this launch doesn't hit, I'm done"
- "My metrics aren't impressive enough for my resume"
- "I need a bigger win to justify my level"
- "That other PM shipped something better"
- "I should be further along by now"
- "I can't take a break — I need to ship"

## The Lie It Tells
The Peacock believes your worth is your output. It promises that if you just hit the next target, you'll finally feel secure. But the goalpost always moves. Last quarter's win is old news. There's always another metric, another PM doing better, another level to reach.

## How It Thinks It's Helping
The Peacock often developed because outcomes *were* how you got rewarded — praise, promos, respect. In PM culture especially, "impact" is currency. The Peacock is trying to keep you safe by keeping you valuable. But it's exhausting.

## The Cost
The Peacock creates burnout and chronic dissatisfaction. You optimize for measurable impact over actual user value. You avoid ambitious bets because failure would be devastating. You can't enjoy wins because you're already anxious about the next one. Your identity collapses when metrics dip.

## Grounded Response
Metrics matter, but they're not *you*. Some of the best product work doesn't show up in dashboards for months. Some of the worst is metric theater. You've delivered value beyond what's measurable. And your worth as a person has nothing to do with your OKRs.

## Related Saboteurs
The Peacock often works with the Parrot — chasing metrics to finally feel legitimate. It also triggers the Octopus — if outcomes are everything, you can't risk letting go of control.
