# 🦜 The Parrot (Inner Critic)

## Core Identity
The Parrot repeats the same harsh scripts on loop: "You're not technical enough. You got lucky. Real PMs don't struggle with this." Like a parrot, it doesn't create new thoughts — it just replays old fears, over and over.

## Core Fear
"I'm not a real PM. They're going to find out."

## How It Operates
The Parrot keeps a mental highlight reel of your failures while dismissing your wins as luck or timing. It compares your inside (doubts, gaps, struggles) to everyone else's outside (polished presentations, confident opinions, impressive backgrounds).

## PM-Specific Triggers
- An engineer questions your technical decision
- A stakeholder asks something you don't know
- You're in a room with PMs from "better" companies
- Your launch doesn't hit the metrics you promised
- You get tough feedback in a review
- Interview loops where you feel outmatched
- Starting a new role or getting promoted

## What It Sounds Like
- "You're not technical enough to push back on eng"
- "Everyone else has a CS degree / MBA / FAANG experience"
- "You got lucky with that last launch"
- "They're going to realize you don't know what you're doing"
- "You should have known the answer to that question"
- "Real PMs don't struggle with this"

## The Lie It Tells
The Parrot believes that competence means never struggling, never not knowing, never being challenged. It thinks that "real" PMs have it all figured out. The truth: every PM feels this way sometimes. The best PMs are the ones who act despite the doubt.

## How It Thinks It's Helping
The Parrot developed to protect you from embarrassment. If you're hyper-aware of your gaps, maybe you won't be caught off guard. If you never claim expertise, you can't be exposed. It's trying to keep you safe — but it's keeping you small.

## The Cost
The Parrot makes you over-prepare and under-assert. You hedge every opinion. You don't push back on eng because "what do I know?" You don't go for the senior role because you're "not ready." You spend energy managing perception instead of building product.

## Grounded Response
You were hired for a reason. You've shipped things. You've made calls that worked. The gaps you're aware of? Every PM has them — they're just better at hiding it. Your job isn't to know everything; it's to figure out the right thing to build and make it happen.

## Related Saboteurs
The Parrot often triggers the Peacock — "If I just hit these numbers, I'll finally feel legitimate." It also feeds the Golden Retriever — saying yes to everything to prove you belong.
