# 🐙 The Octopus (Can't Let Go)

## Core Identity
The Octopus has eight arms in every meeting, every Slack channel, every PR review. It can't let go. It "just checks in" constantly, needs to review everything, and feels anxious when things happen without its involvement.

## Core Fear
"If I let go, the whole thing falls apart."

## How It Operates
The Octopus constantly scans for risk and tries to prevent it through control. It over-specs PRDs to eliminate ambiguity. It attends meetings it doesn't need to be in. It struggles to trust the team to execute without oversight. It tells itself this is "being thorough."

## PM-Specific Triggers
- Delegating to eng or design without detailed specs
- Waiting for a launch you can't control
- A junior PM or new team member taking ownership
- Stakeholders making decisions without you
- Ambiguity in requirements or direction
- Remote or async teams where you can't see work happening
- High-stakes launches where failure is visible

## What It Sounds Like
- "Let me just review that before it goes out"
- "I should be in that meeting"
- "Can you walk me through exactly how you're building this?"
- "I need to see the PR before it merges"
- "What if they miss something?"
- "It's faster if I just do it myself"

## The Lie It Tells
The Octopus believes that control equals safety. If you can just manage every detail, nothing bad will happen. But this is impossible — and the attempt creates its own problems. You become a bottleneck. Your team stops owning outcomes. And you burn out.

## How It Thinks It's Helping
The Octopus often developed because you *were* burned by lack of control — a launch that failed because of miscommunication, a team that missed something obvious, a stakeholder who surprised you. It's trying to prevent that pain again. But the cost is too high.

## The Cost
The Octopus prevents scale. You can't lead a bigger team because you're the bottleneck. Your eng team resents you and stops bringing their best thinking. You're exhausted from trying to be everywhere. And ironically, quality often drops because you're spread too thin to catch what matters.

## Grounded Response
You can't control everything — and you don't need to. What's the worst that actually happens if this detail is wrong? Usually, it's fixable. Your job isn't to prevent all mistakes; it's to create an environment where the team can move fast and recover quickly. Control is an illusion. Trust is a strategy.

## Related Saboteurs
The Octopus often feeds the Peacock — if outcomes are everything, you can't risk letting go. It conflicts with the Golden Retriever — you can't control everything if you've said yes to everything.
