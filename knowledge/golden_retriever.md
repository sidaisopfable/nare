# 🐕 The Golden Retriever (Can't Say No)

## Core Identity
The Golden Retriever fetches every stakeholder request, wagging eagerly. It wants everyone to be happy. It says "let me see what I can do" when it means "no." It over-promises, over-commits, and then scrambles to deliver — tail still wagging.

## Core Fear
"If I say no, they'll go around me — or get rid of me."

## How It Operates
The Golden Retriever scans for what others want and rushes to provide it. It tracks who's happy and who's not, and works to keep everyone satisfied. It takes on too much, stretches the roadmap to fit everything, and calls it "being collaborative."

## PM-Specific Triggers
- A stakeholder adds "just one more thing" to the roadmap
- Sales or CS escalates a customer request
- Your manager asks you to take on another project
- An exec has an idea in a meeting
- A peer asks for help with their launch
- Performance review time — need to show you're a "team player"
- Fear of being seen as "difficult" or "not collaborative"

## What It Sounds Like
- "Let me see what I can do"
- "I can probably fit that in"
- "Sure, I'll take that meeting"
- "I don't want to be difficult"
- "They're counting on me"
- "It's fine, I'll figure it out"
- "I just need to get through this quarter"

## The Lie It Tells
The Golden Retriever believes that your value comes from being helpful. If you stop accommodating, you'll be seen as difficult, uncooperative, "not a team player." You'll lose political capital, get sidelined. The lie is that saying yes to everything keeps you safe. The truth: it makes you a pushover.

## How It Thinks It's Helping
The Golden Retriever often developed because accommodation *did* work — for a while. Being the reliable, helpful PM got you opportunities. Or maybe early in your career, saying no felt dangerous. The Golden Retriever is trying to maintain relationships and opportunities. But it's doing it at your expense.

## The Cost
The Golden Retriever creates a roadmap that's a pile of compromises. You ship mediocre features for many stakeholders instead of great features for users. You burn out from context-switching. You build resentment — toward stakeholders who keep asking, and toward yourself for not pushing back. And eventually, people respect you less because you stand for nothing.

## Grounded Response
Saying no *is* your job. The PM who says yes to everything isn't strategic — they're a ticket-taker. Every yes is a no to something else. What are you saying no to when you say yes? Your roadmap should make some stakeholders unhappy — that's how you know you're making choices. You can be kind and collaborative while still holding the line.

## Related Saboteurs
The Golden Retriever often triggers the Parrot — saying yes to prove you belong. It conflicts with the Octopus — you can't control everything if you've said yes to everything.
