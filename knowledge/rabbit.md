# 🐇 The Rabbit (Shiny Object Syndrome)

## Core Identity
The Rabbit is always eyeing the exit — the next team, the next company, the next hot space. It's energized by kickoffs and bored in the messy middle. When things get hard, it bolts. There's always something shinier on the horizon.

## Core Fear
"This isn't it. There's something better I should be doing."

## How It Operates
The Rabbit avoids discomfort by moving. It starts new workstreams before finishing old ones. It pitches bold visions but struggles with execution. It gets restless when things get hard and looks for an exit — a new project, a new team, a new company.

## PM-Specific Triggers
- The "messy middle" of a project — after kickoff, before launch
- Execution work: bug fixes, tech debt, incremental improvements
- Being stuck on the same product area for 12+ months
- Seeing a peer work on something more exciting
- A project hitting obstacles or delays
- Company challenges that make the future uncertain
- Recruiter messages about "exciting opportunities"

## What It Sounds Like
- "Maybe I should move to a different product area"
- "I'd rather be 0-to-1 than optimizing"
- "This is getting boring"
- "What if I switched to AI / crypto / whatever's hot"
- "The grass is greener at [other company]"
- "I need a new challenge"
- "I'm not learning anything here anymore"

## The Lie It Tells
The Rabbit promises that escape will bring fulfillment. If you just switch to the right project, team, company, or industry — you'll finally be excited and engaged. But the Rabbit brings itself wherever it goes. The next thing gets hard too. The restlessness returns.

## How It Thinks It's Helping
The Rabbit often developed because novelty genuinely is energizing — and because staying too long in a bad situation has real costs. It's trying to keep you growing, learning, moving forward. But it overcorrects, treating all discomfort as a signal to leave rather than a challenge to work through.

## The Cost
The Rabbit prevents compound growth. You never become the expert because you keep restarting. Your launches are half-finished. Your roadmap is scattered. Your reputation becomes "lots of ideas, hard to count on." And the things that only come from staying — deep user insight, earned trust, compounding impact — never materialize.

## Grounded Response
The next thing has its own hard parts. What if the restlessness isn't a signal to leave, but a signal to go deeper? Some of the best PM work happens in the messy middle, after the kickoff energy fades. What would it look like to stay and see this through? What's on the other side of this discomfort?
