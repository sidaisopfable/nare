# The Grounded PM

## What It Is
The Grounded PM is not another saboteur — it's the part of you that can observe all the saboteurs without being controlled by them. It's the awareness that notices "the Parrot is loud right now" without believing everything it says.

## Core Qualities

### Calm
The Grounded PM doesn't react to every Slack message, stakeholder request, or metric dip. It can feel the urgency without being hijacked by it. This isn't passivity — it's the steady presence that makes good decisions possible.

### Curious
Rather than fighting the saboteurs or feeling ashamed of them, the Grounded PM gets curious. "Interesting — the Golden Retriever is really active in this stakeholder conversation. What's it afraid of?" This curiosity creates space for choice.

### Compassionate
The Grounded PM treats all parts with kindness. These saboteurs developed for reasons — they were once adaptive, protective, necessary. The Parrot protected you from overconfidence. The Octopus came from a launch that failed. They deserve understanding, not condemnation.

### Clear
The Grounded PM can see what's actually happening versus the stories the saboteurs tell. It can distinguish between "this launch underperformed" and "I'm a failure." Between "this stakeholder is frustrated" and "everyone hates me."

## How It Responds
When a saboteur is active, the Grounded PM:

1. **Notices** — "The Peacock is activated right now."
2. **Validates** — "That makes sense. There's real pressure around these OKRs."
3. **Questions the lie** — "But is my worth actually tied to this number?"
4. **Opens a door** — "What would I do here if I weren't afraid?"

## The Grounded PM in Action

**In a stakeholder meeting:**
The Golden Retriever wants to say "sure, we can add that." The Grounded PM pauses and says: "I hear that's important. Help me understand the problem you're solving, and I'll see how it fits with our priorities."

**After a tough launch:**
The Parrot says "I'm a fraud." The Peacock says "My career is over." The Grounded PM says: "This hurts. The launch didn't land. What can I learn? What's actually in my control for next time?"

**When feeling restless:**
The Rabbit says "I should switch teams." The Grounded PM asks: "Is this a signal to leave, or a signal to go deeper? What would I need to make this current situation work?"

## How to Access It
The Grounded PM is always present — just often obscured by the noise. Ways to access it:

- **Pause** — Don't respond to that Slack message for 10 minutes
- **Name it** — "That's the Parrot talking"
- **Zoom out** — "Will this matter in 6 months?"
- **Ask** — "What would I do here if I weren't afraid?"

## The Goal
The goal isn't to eliminate your saboteurs — they're part of you, and sometimes they have useful information. The goal is to recognize when they're driving and gently take back the wheel. You can feel the Parrot's fear without letting it make your decisions.
