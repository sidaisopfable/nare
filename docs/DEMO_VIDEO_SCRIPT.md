## FULL SCRIPT

```
[SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM — thoughtful, ~25s]

Product managers face a lot of trials. You know the feeling — stuck in a spiral after a rejection, drowning in decisions, or saying yes to everything. 

The problem isn't always what happened. It's the story you tell yourself about what happened. 

And not everyone has easy access to a great coach or mentor who can help you see things differently.

---

[SECTION 2: THE SOLUTION — hopeful, ~10s]

What if you had a confidential, privacy-first ally — available on demand — to help reframe your thinking around the problems you face every day as a PM?

---

[SECTION 3: INTRODUCING NARE — ~15s]

Introducing Nare — that's "Narry," like Larry — the Narrative Reframer. An experimental confidential coach for Product Managers.

I built Nare over 2 weeks, pair-programming with Claude. It started as a learning project to understand RAG, evals, and prompt engineering — but it turned into something I actually use myself.

---

[SECTION 4: HOW IT WORKS — explaining, ~25s]

You start by picking your situation, then describe what's going on. The example text gives you a starting point, but you can edit it to reflect what's actually happening.

Nare puts you in control. You choose between two models — Claude for the best quality, or Ollama for maximum privacy where your data never leaves your device. You can even run both simultaneously and compare results.

To use Claude, just add your own API key — easy instructions included. Then hit "Get Coaching" and watch it stream in real-time.

---

[SECTION 5: THE RESPONSE — describing, ~30s]

Nare's framework is built on the idea that we all have inner saboteurs — patterns that hold us back from being our best selves. To keep responses grounded in the underlying psychology, Nare uses Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.

In this example, Nare identifies the Parrot — the inner critic. It helps you see that your current narrative isn't fixed reality, and calls out the Parrot as the voice running the show. 

Nare responds with a grounded perspective and a question to reflect on. You can keep the conversation going as long as you want. Don't like a response? Hit regenerate for a fresh take.

Nare shows cost and token usage so there are no surprises on your Claude bill. You can share feedback for your own reference, and all chats are logged locally — only you have access to these personal conversations.

---

[SECTION 6: THE PSYCHOLOGY — reassuring, ~15s]

For the psychology nerds: Nare's framework synthesizes research from Internal Family Systems, CBT, and ACT — mapped to 5 memorable animal personas. The Parrot, the Peacock, the Octopus, the Golden Retriever, and the Rabbit. 

You can explore each saboteur inside Nare, with external links to the underlying research.

---

[SECTION 7: FOR GENAI NERDS — excited, ~15s]

For the GenAI and Data Science nerds: Nare comes with a robust built-in eval dashboard. A golden dataset with 37 labeled test cases, precision, recall, F1 scores — the works. Compare Claude and Ollama side by side. Comprehensive local logging for cost, tokens, and performance — all for your eyes only.

---

[SECTION 8: CLOSING — emphatic + CTA, ~10s]

Nare is built by a PM, for PMs, on the principle of privacy-first. Your data is always yours.

Please note: Nare is not a replacement for a therapist. Use with care.

Nare is open source — link in the description. If you're a PM who's ever been stuck in your own head, give it a try.
