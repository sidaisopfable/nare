# Sage Framework: Complete Reference

## Overview

Sage helps people recognize self-sabotaging mental patterns and access a grounded perspective. The framework identifies five core patterns that hijack our thinking, and offers the Grounded Self as an alternative voice.

## Pattern 1: The Parrot (Inner Critic)

### Core Fear
"I'm not enough."

### What It Does
The Parrot repeats harsh, critical scripts — often things we heard growing up or internalized from past failures. It finds fault with everything you do, creating a running commentary of self-judgment. The Parrot is relentless and repetitive, saying the same negative things over and over until you believe them.

### How to Recognize It
- Harsh inner voice that judges your every move
- "Should have" and "shouldn't have" thinking
- Finding fault with yourself even when things go well
- Repetitive negative scripts that play on loop
- Comparing yourself unfavorably to others
- Feeling like nothing you do is ever good enough

### What It Sounds Like
- "You should have done better."
- "What's wrong with you?"
- "You always mess this up."
- "Everyone else can do this, why can't you?"
- "You're such an idiot."
- "You should be further along by now."

### The Lie It Tells
The Parrot wants you to believe that harsh self-criticism will motivate you to improve. Research shows the opposite — self-compassion is more effective for growth and resilience.

### Common Triggers
- Making a mistake
- Receiving criticism from others
- Comparing yourself to peers
- Falling short of your own expectations
- Rejection or failure

### Grounded Self Response to the Parrot
The Parrot is loud right now, but volume isn't truth. Notice the harsh tone — would you speak to a friend this way? The criticism feels like it's protecting you from future failure, but it's actually keeping you stuck. What would it sound like to acknowledge the mistake without attacking yourself?

## Pattern 2: The Peacock (Insecure Performer)

### Core Fear
"I'm only worth what I produce."

### What It Does
The Peacock ties your entire self-worth to achievement, status, and external validation. It's never satisfied — there's always another goal, another comparison, another way you're falling short. The Peacock keeps you on a treadmill of accomplishment, believing that the next achievement will finally make you feel worthy.

### How to Recognize It
- Constantly measuring yourself against others
- Feeling worthless during unproductive periods
- Needing external validation to feel okay
- Workaholism or inability to rest
- Defining yourself by your resume or accomplishments
- Fear that slowing down means falling behind

### What It Sounds Like
- "What have you accomplished lately?"
- "You're falling behind your peers."
- "If this fails, you're a failure."
- "You need to do more."
- "Rest is for people who've earned it."
- "Your worth is your output."

### The Lie It Tells
The Peacock wants you to believe that your worth is conditional — that you must constantly prove yourself to deserve love, respect, or even basic self-acceptance. But you existed before your achievements, and your worth doesn't disappear when you rest.

### Common Triggers
- Seeing others succeed
- Periods of low productivity
- Job loss or career setbacks
- Comparing your behind-the-scenes to others' highlight reels
- Being asked "what do you do?"

### Grounded Self Response to the Peacock
The Peacock is measuring again, but worth isn't a scorecard. You're not falling behind — you're on your own path. The constant comparison is exhausting, and it's not even accurate. What would it mean to let yourself be enough, right now, without the next accomplishment?

## Pattern 3: The Octopus (Anxious Controller)

### Core Fear
"If I let go, disaster follows."

### What It Does
The Octopus needs eight arms in everything. It micromanages, struggles to delegate, and feels anxious when things are outside its control. The Octopus believes that vigilance and control are the only things preventing catastrophe. It exhausts you by trying to manage every variable.

### How to Recognize It
- Difficulty delegating or trusting others
- Micromanaging projects or people
- Anxiety when you're not in charge
- Believing only you can do things right
- Constant mental list of things that need monitoring
- Feeling responsible for outcomes you can't control

### What It Sounds Like
- "If you're not in charge, everything falls apart."
- "You can't trust anyone else to do it right."
- "You need to stay on top of this."
- "What if something goes wrong while you're not watching?"
- "Let me just handle this myself."
- "I need to know the plan."

### The Lie It Tells
The Octopus wants you to believe that control equals safety. But the truth is, you can't control everything — and trying to is exhausting. Some of the best outcomes come from letting go and trusting the process.

### Common Triggers
- Delegating important tasks
- Uncertainty or ambiguity
- Waiting for outcomes you can't influence
- Other people doing things differently than you would
- Situations where you have responsibility but not authority

### Grounded Self Response to the Octopus
The Octopus has all eight arms out, trying to hold everything together. But you can't grip your way to peace. What's one thing you could release right now and trust won't collapse? Control is an illusion — what would it feel like to let go, just a little?

## Pattern 4: The Golden Retriever (Compulsive Pleaser)

### Core Fear
"I'll be rejected if I disappoint."

### What It Does
The Golden Retriever compulsively prioritizes others' needs over your own. It says yes when you mean no, over-gives until you're depleted, and then feels resentful that no one reciprocates. The Golden Retriever believes love and acceptance must be earned through endless giving and accommodation.

### How to Recognize It
- Saying yes when you want to say no
- Feeling responsible for others' emotions
- Difficulty setting or maintaining boundaries
- Resentment building from over-giving
- Seeking approval before making decisions
- Fear of disappointing others

### What It Sounds Like
- "They need you."
- "You can't let them down."
- "What will they think of you?"
- "It's fine, I don't mind." (when you do mind)
- "I should be there for them."
- "If I say no, they won't like me."

### The Lie It Tells
The Golden Retriever wants you to believe that love must be earned through constant giving. But real relationships include mutual care — and people who only love you when you're giving aren't offering real love.

### Common Triggers
- Someone expressing disappointment
- Opportunities to say no
- Seeing someone struggle (feeling compelled to fix it)
- Requests for your time or energy
- Conflict or potential conflict

### Grounded Self Response to the Golden Retriever
The Golden Retriever is wagging its tail, desperate to please. But you're allowed to have needs too. What did you say yes to that you wish you'd said no to? The resentment you're feeling is a signal — a boundary was crossed, maybe by you. What would it look like to disappoint someone and still be okay?

## Pattern 5: The Rabbit (Restless Escapist)

### Core Fear
"This present moment is unbearable."

### What It Does
The Rabbit is always ready to bolt. It seeks the next opportunity, the next distraction, the next escape route. The Rabbit can't sit with discomfort, so it keeps moving — changing jobs, starting new projects, abandoning things halfway. It mistakes motion for progress.

### How to Recognize It
- Constant urge to start something new
- Difficulty finishing what you start
- "Grass is greener" thinking
- Seeking rescue or external solutions
- Avoiding difficult emotions or conversations
- Restlessness when things are stable

### What It Sounds Like
- "This isn't it."
- "There's something better out there."
- "Let's just move on to the next thing."
- "Maybe if I change jobs/cities/relationships..."
- "I'm bored."
- "Someone or something will save me from this."

### The Lie It Tells
The Rabbit wants you to believe that escape will bring peace. But the next field has its own problems. Running doesn't solve anything — it just relocates your patterns.

### Common Triggers
- Boredom or monotony
- Difficult emotions that feel unbearable
- Conflict or discomfort
- Seeing new opportunities (even when current situation is fine)
- Feeling stuck or trapped

### Grounded Self Response to the Rabbit
The Rabbit wants to bolt, but the next field has its own foxes. What are you running from? What would it mean to stay — not forever, but just for now? The restlessness is a signal, but the answer isn't escape. What's one thing worth staying present for right now?

## The Grounded Self

### What It Is
The Grounded Self is not another pattern — it's the part of you that can observe all the patterns without being controlled by them. It's the wise, calm presence that exists beneath the noise.

### Qualities of the Grounded Self
- **Calm** — not reactive
- **Curious** — not judgmental
- **Compassionate** — not harsh
- **Clear** — can see what's actually happening
- **Present** — not lost in past or future

### How It Responds
When the Grounded Self speaks, it:
1. **Validates** — "I see what's happening. This is hard."
2. **Names the pattern** — "The Peacock is measuring again."
3. **Names the lie** — "It wants you to believe your worth is conditional."
4. **Offers truth** — "But you existed before this achievement."
5. **Asks a question** — "What would it mean to be enough right now?"

### What It Doesn't Do
The Grounded Self doesn't:
- Lecture or preach
- Offer quick fixes
- Dismiss your feelings
- Add more pressure
- Pretend everything is fine

### The Goal
The goal isn't to eliminate your patterns — they're part of you, and they developed for reasons. The goal is to recognize when a pattern is driving, and gently take back the wheel.

## Working with Multiple Patterns

Often, several patterns activate together:

### Common Combinations
- **Parrot + Peacock**: Self-criticism about not achieving enough
- **Octopus + Rabbit**: Controlling everything while wanting to escape
- **Golden Retriever + Parrot**: Over-giving, then criticizing yourself for not giving more
- **Peacock + Rabbit**: Achieving compulsively, then wanting to abandon it all

### When Multiple Patterns Are Active
The Grounded Self doesn't try to address everything at once. It:
1. Names what's happening: "There's a lot going on right now."
2. Picks the loudest pattern to address first
3. Stays brief — less is more
4. Trusts that clarity on one pattern often calms the others
